## FEATURES

- No dependency on third party libraries
- Works on Windows, Linux & macOS
- Works in 32bpp graphics mode emulating text mode colors and true color extensions
- Supports most common ANSI escape sequences and even some obscure ones
  - All relevant [ANSI Escape Sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code)
  - All relevant [ANSI.SYS Escape Sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI.SYS)
  - [PabloDraw](https://github.com/cwensley/pablodraw) 24bpp color escape sequence
- Supports embedded [ANSI music](docs/ansimtech.txt) - WIP
- Supports [ANSImation](http://www.roysac.com/ansianim.html) content
- Support querying width and height of the content in characters - WIP
- Easy plug-&-play API - OK
- Loads and renders [ANS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_art), ASC, DIZ, NFO and TXT files
- Includes a demo viewer to show how to use the library

## USAGE

- Clone the repository to a directory of your choice
- Open Terminal and change to the directory using an appropriate OS command
- Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to initialize, fetch and checkout git submodules
- Open *ANSIPrint64.bas* in the QB64-PE IDE and press `F5` to compile and run
- To use the library in your project add the [Toolbox64](https://github.com/a740g/Toolbox64) repositiory as a [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)

## API

```VB
' Easy top-level API (call and forget style)
Sub PrintANSI (sANSI As String)

' Core library functions (if more control is required)
Sub InitializeANSIEmulator
Sub ResetANSIEmulator
Sub SetANSIEmulationSpeed (nCPS As Long)
Function PrintANSICharacter& (ch As Unsigned Byte)
Function PrintANSIString& (s As String)

' Library support functions
Sub SetANSICanvasColor (c As Unsigned Long, isBackground As Long, isLegacy As Long)
Function GetANSICanvasWidth&
Function GetANSICanvasHeight&
Sub ClearANSICanvasArea (l As Long, t As Long, r As Long, b As Long)
```

## FAQ

What can I do with this?

- Anything you want! Use it in games, demos or for writing pretty text mode user interfaces and output.

Can you implment feature x / y?

- With the limited time I have between my day job, home and family, there is only so much I can do. I do maintain a list of TODO (see below). However, those do not have any set deadlines. If you need something implemented, submit a GitHub issue about it or do it yourself and submit a PR.

I found a bug. How can I help?

- Let me know using GitHub issues or fix it yourself and submit a PR!

Can this be used in a game / demo?

- Absolutely. The demo code included in a good example.

## NOTES

- This requires the latest version of [QB64-PE](https://github.com/QB64-Phoenix-Edition/QB64pe)
- The renderer is designed for QB64's 32BPP graphics Window. Legacy `SCREEN`s will not work
- This is WIP. So, expect things to change and break. There are some bugs and quirks that needs to be worked out
- When you clone a repository that contains submodules, the submodules are not automatically cloned by default
- You will need to use the `git submodule update --init --recursive` to initialize, fetch and checkout git submodules
