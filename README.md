## GOALS

- No dependency on third party libraries - OK
- No OS specific code - OK
- Support all meaninful [ANSI Escape Sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) - OK
- Support all meaninful [ANSI.SYS Escape Sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI.SYS) - OK
- Support all meaninful non-ANSI escape sequences (e.g. [PabloDraw](https://github.com/cwensley/pablodraw) 24bpp colors) - OK
- Support embedded [ANSI music](docs/ansimtech.txt) - WIP
- Support [animated ANSI](http://www.roysac.com/ansianim.html) content - OK
- Support querying width and height of the content in characters - WIP
- Easy plug-&-play API - OK
- Load and render all [ANS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_art), ASC, DIZ, NFO and TXT files in the repository correctly - WIP
- Include a demo viewer to show how to use the library - OK

## WHAT CAN I DO WITH THIS?

Anything you want! Use it in games, demos or for writing pretty text mode user interfaces and output.

## NOTES

- This requires the latest version of [QB64-PE](https://github.com/QB64-Phoenix-Edition/QB64pe)
- The renderer is designed for QB64's 32BPP graphics Window. Legacy `SCREEN`s will not work
- This is WIP. So, expect things to change and break. There are some bugs and quirks that needs to be worked out
